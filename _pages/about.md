I’m a University of Toronto graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Computer Science, with a minor in History. My work spans machine learning research, AI engineering, and data systems; especially pipelines, verification, and management. I’ve built several self-directed projects across these areas, focusing on practical experimentation and clear, reproducible results.
