# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR.

Explain what problem you are addressing, why it matters, and how your tool helps.

Typical flow:

Context: Bayesian Neural Networks are powerful but difficult to inspect and debug.

Problem: There is limited tooling for understanding learned weight distributions.

Contribution: This project provides a modular logging and analysis framework for BNNs, with clear visualization and statistical tools.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data

# Background

What are BNNs?

What is Bayesian Information Sharing?

How does this build on libraries like torchbnn?

What gaps existed that your project fills?


# Model

Here you describe how the system works. For your project, this would include:

The distribution logging structure (distribution_log dictionary)

The key modules/functions (get_all_distribution_params, plot_epoch_distributions, etc.)

Any custom architecture elements, like your HierarchicalBayesLinear layer

# Analysis and Visualization

This is really to show off the tools and get the readers comfortable with what the plots mean.

Here you demonstrate what your tool enables:

Examples of plots over epochs

Example KL divergence tables

Insights about parameter convergence or prior/posterior similarity

You can also include one or two small case studies â€” for instance, training a small BNN and showing how the tool reveals layer behavior over time.

# Results

This section is about what you learned from using your tool.

How do priors and posteriors behave?

Which visualization was most informative?

Any notable findings about model uncertainty or stability?


# Conclusion, Discussion and Future Work

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
